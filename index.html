<h1 style="font-size:350%;text-align:center;">Toddler and Preschooler ages</h1>
<p style="font-size:150%;"> Toddlers are between ages 1 to 3, and preschoolers are between ages 3-5. Most toddlers start walking
  at the age of three. At this age you might take them to daycare. It is important to socialize your toddler and indroduce new things and activities
  to them. This will help them build some social skills for the future. Around this age toddlers will develop their fine motor skills and gross motor 
  skills which is why you must indroduce new activities to your child so they may develop those skills. The more exposed your child is to new things 
  the more developed they will become. You must also train your child to not be overly dependent on you which could led to separation anxiety.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:350%;">A toddler's health</h1>
  <p style="font-size:150%;"> Remember that regular medical care is important to ensure your toddler's heath, and checkups are recommended starting 
  at around 12, 24, and 36 months old. Dental.  checkups become a necessity beginning after the age of two and should continue every 6 months to maitain
    healthy teeth. Sleep is also essential for a child's growth. Toddlers need 10  to 15 hours of sleep each day, and preschoolers need 11 to 13 hours 
    of sleep each day. Make sure you create a night routine before your child goes to bed to practice a good sleep schedule. Naps during the day are 
    normal and at least one nap per day is necessary for your child. Overnight accidents, like bed-wetting, may occur and your child will grow out of 
    this habit as he/she becomes older. Just remember not to let your child drink too much before bed to prevent this. A night lamp is also a good idea 
    to help if your child has a fear of the dark.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:350%;">Toilet training</h1>
   <p style="font-size:150%;"> Toilet training should not be taught too early to the child. Usually potty training starts after the child is around 18 
     months. It also varies between genders. Girls usually learn toilet training faster than boys. Boys start to learn at the age of 3, while girls start 
     at age 2. When your child is able to start controling their bodily functions that is how you know they are ready to be potty trained. You must be very
     patient in this proccess because it could take months for your child to learn this. Bowl movements also take longer to tain becuaes it may be hard for 
     your child to identify.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:350%;text-align:center;">Preschool-aged cognitive development</h1>
   <p style="font-size:150%;"> Around the ages 2 to 7 is when your child will start to develop some language skills. Childern often may not have concrete
     logic and cannot mentally manipulate information like adults. They are unable to take the point of view of other people which is why they much be taught
     with lots of patience. Childern at this time uses symbols and pretend play to learn. Often they have a hard time to categorize things because they don't 
     understand that objects can be the same even if they look different. Childern only see from thier own viewpoint not someone eles's perspective.</p>
   <img src="image\thinking.png" alt="">
  <h1 style="font-size:350%;">Language development</h1>
  <p style="font-size:150%;"> Most language development occurs at this time. Your child will experience a rapid expansion of vocabulary and often they get 
    frustrated when they can't communicate their wants. Sometimes they might even invent words to express themselves. At the age of 4, childeren tend to ask 
    a lot of questions. They can handle five word sentences, and may have 1500 word vocbularies. At 5 years of age, they can make six word sentences, and use
    as many as 2000 words.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:350%;text-align:center;">Child Influences</h1>
  <p style="font-size:150%;">Ever heard the saying "children see, children do"? Children are often influenced by their parents, society, and peers to do the
    things they do. Parents are the main influences to their child. Early bonds between you and your child will impact the child thoughout his/her life to be 
    close to you. Insecure attachments formed will lead to avoidance in the future.</p>
  <h1 style="font-size:350%;">Parenting Styles</h1>
  <p style="font-size:150%;">There are many parenting methods and styles that are used that could either have a negative and positive inmpact on the child. The 
    most populatr parenting styles that should be avoided includes; autrhoritarian, permissive, and uninvolved parenting. Authoritarian is used by strict
    parents that expect the child to obey without any explanation. This often includes high demands from the parent, but not responsive to the child. Permissive 
    parenting is the opposite. Few demands from the parent and the child is rarely disciplined. Uninvolved parenting is exactly how it sounds. The parent does not 
    interact with their child and may neglect the child and their needs. All these methods that were just described should be avoided when parenting. Instead,
    authoritative parenting will have a positive outcome in your child. Authoritative parenting is a method where the parent sets rules for the child is responsive 
    their child and are willing to answer their questions. The parents are also supportive of the child.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:350%;text-align:center;">Disciplining Your Child</h1>
  <p style="font-size:150%;">At this age, childern may test limits in unsafe or socially unacceptable ways. Guidance and discipline are used to redirect childern 
    into a safe or socially acceptable manner. You want to teach childern self control, independence, safety, and forms of socially acceptable actions and behavior.
    Discipline is the practice of using a reward or punishment to correct bad behavior. You must punish your child as a consequence for an unacceptable behavior.
    There are three types of strategies used to discipline a child; power assertion, love withdrawal, and induction. Power assertion is a type of discipline where
    the parent uses physical punishment or denies the child. This is also known as corporal punishment which can physically and emotionally hurt the child. Like 
    spanking or verbally scolding your child. Love withdrawal includes threating to remove love, even temporarily from the caregiver and child relationship. This 
    could look like giving the child the "silent treatment". Induction includes logic and explanation to adress a child's action or behavior. For example, this 
    would be listening to the child, understanding the action and explaining why it is not acceptable. Also, be aware of what your child is watching on TV and 
    video games. Limit video games and avoid any TV violence. Your child might hear curse words from TV and don't understand that these words can be inappropriate.
    It is your job to teach them to practice good manners by disciplining them the right way to avoid bad inappropriate behaviors.</p>
