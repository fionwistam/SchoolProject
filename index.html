<h1 style="font-size:350%;text-align:center;">Toddler and Preschooler ages</h1>
<p style="font-size:150%;"> Toddlers are between ages 1 to 3, and preschoolers are between ages 3-5. Most toddlers start walking
  at the age of three. At this age you might take them to daycare. It is important to socialize your toddler and indroduce new things and activities
  to them. This will help them build some social skills for the future. Around this age toddlers will develop their fine motor skills and gross motor 
  skills which is why you must indroduce new activities to your child so they may develop those skills. The more exposed your child is to new things 
  the more developed they will become. You must also train your child to not be overly dependent on you which could led to separation anxiety.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:350%;">A toddler's health</h1>
  <p style="font-size:150%;"> Remember that regular medical care is important to ensure your toddler's heath, and checkups are recommended starting 
  at around 12, 24, and 36 months old. Dental.  checkups become a necessity beginning after the age of two and should continue every 6 months to maitain
    healthy teeth. Sleep is also essential for a child's growth. Toddlers need 10  to 15 hours of sleep each day, and preschoolers need 11 to 13 hours 
    of sleep each day. Make sure you create a night routine before your child goes to bed to practice a good sleep schedule. Naps during the day are 
    normal and at least one nap per day is necessary for your child. Overnight accidents, like bed-wetting, may occur and your child will grow out of 
    this habit as he/she becomes older. Just remember not to let your child drink too much before bed to prevent this. A night lamp is also a good idea 
    to help if your child has a fear of the dark.
