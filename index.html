<h1 style="font-size:350%;text-align:center;">Toddler and Preschooler ages</h1>
<p style="font-size:250%;text-align:center;"> Toddlers are between ages 1 to 3, and preschoolers are between ages 3-5. Most toddlers start walking
  at the age of three. At this age you might take them to daycare. It is important to socialize your toddler and indroduce new things and activities
  to them. This will help them build some social skills for the future. Around this age toddlers will develop their fine motor skills and gross motor 
  skills which is why you must indroduce new activities to your child so they may develop those skills. The more exposed your child is to new things 
  the more developed they will become. You must also train your child to not be overly dependent on you which could led to separation anxiety.
